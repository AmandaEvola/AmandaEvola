### About Me ðŸŒ±

####  
- I am currently learning Python, Flask, Django, and even databases and containers such as SQL, Docker, and Kubernetes. 

- My biggest goal is to be at a point where I can utilize my skills in operations and development so I can become a backend developer, devops, system administration, etc. (but my biggest wish is to be involved somewhere on the development side since I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development but prefer working on the back-end).

- I also enjoy volunteering and have volunteered at several animal shelters, mental health organizations, etc. and I hope to volunteer more in the future

- I am also a huge Star Trek: The Original Series fan and I eventually want to make it out to a Comic Con or something similar. You can add me on LinkedIn at - https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandaevola as well as on here on GitHub.

### Projects
- MovieList (https://github.com/AmandaEvola/MovieList) This is a project I created utilizing the Python programming language as well as HTML for the front-end, and the framework Flask to show you movies you are looking for, where I harnessed my skills in project management, full-stack development, and the use of RESTful APIs.

- Intermediate-Python-Concepts (https://github.com/AmandaEvola/Intermediate-Python-Concepts) The project I created showcasing knowledge of intermediate Python concepts, explains different concepts to you such as functions, arguments, parameters, immutable vs mutable lists, etc.

- Pong (https://github.com/AmandaEvola/Pong) This game I created was one of the first projects I had completed learning beginner to intermediate Python concepts where I created a fun game (originally released in 1972).

- I also have more projects involving Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and more, and plan on and am developing new projects every day -> (https://github.com/AmandaEvola/datastructuresandalgorithms) (https://github.com/AmandaEvola/car.py) <- My Object-Oriented programming and Data Structures and Algorithms projects here.
